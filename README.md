# Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites

This repository contains a [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) template to create a personal academic website. The template uses the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod), but it modifies it in various ways to be more adapted to academic websites and more minimalist. The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).


## Illustration

The website produced by the template can be viewed at https://edturri.github.io/.

## Features

+ Webpages are organized in three categories, which are available from any page through the menu and from the homepage through buttons: papers, courses, and data.
+ A list of tags (keywords) used in papers and courses is automatically generated so visitors can easily see the topics covered in research and teaching.
+ An archive page is automatically generated so visitors can easily see the most recent material added to the website.
+ The template provides social icons specific to academia: office hours, Zoom, Substack, and Google Scholar.
+ The metadata for webpages, which appear below the webpage title, are tailored to the academic context.
+ Color scheme, font, spacing, buttons, and general appearance have been streamlined and made as minimalist as possible.
+ The template provides new archetypes for paper pages, course pages, and a search page.
